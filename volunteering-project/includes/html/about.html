                    Welcome,
                    <br>
                    We are Or, Snir and Raya - Information systems students at the Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo. DoingGood is a website that connects between volunteers, people who seek help and volunteer associations in order to reach more people who might need help. We believe that many of the volunteers who are trying to do good for others, are not getting the tools they need in order to find where to volunteer. Therefore, many volunteer associations don't get the right amount of personnel available for different jobs. 
                    That is why we created DoingGood! We believe that with an easy-to-use platform we can help volunteers connect with people who need help and volunteer associations the fastest way possible.
